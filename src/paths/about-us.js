                <p>&ldquo;When my water started turning deadly, I decided to go
                on a baking-soda root-beer cleanse. I got addicted immediately;
                the results were great! When I ended up in the hospital two years
                later, I scaled down to lemonade and got into baking. I can make
                a mean apple crisp! It's great!&rdquo; -Austin </p>
